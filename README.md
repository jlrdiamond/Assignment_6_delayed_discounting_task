# Assignment_6_delayed_discounting_task
This repository holds the script and files needed to conduct an amended version of the delayed discounting task found in Peters & BÃ¼chel, 2010. 

The goal of the amendments was to do the following: implement the task with changed the amount of the delayed monetary offers, presenting 60 trials in a random order, 30 with the cue and 30 without. On each trial the participant should have the task of choosing between $20 today and the delayed amount after the delay. At the end of the experiment, the number of times the delayed option was chosen, in the condition the future event cue is shown and the one where it is not, is printed to the console.

To run the script, download the Assignment_6_delay_discounting_task.py file, and the Offers_hw.xlsx file and cues.xlsx, save them at the same same file path, load Assignment_6_delay_discounting_task.py in to PsychoPy, and hit "Run."
